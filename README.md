### Installation

```
npm install optics --save
```

### Usage

```js
const Optics = require('optics');

const source = `
  hello world

  how are you?

  what is up?
`

const patch = `
  hello world

  you are who?

  what is up?
`

const _diff = new Optics(source, patch)
```

Given an Optics instance you can now do the following to view it.

- splitDiff
- combinedDiff
- diff

#### diff

> diff takes the following arguments passed an object
 >`{ isCondensed = false, padding = 4 }`

###### arguments
- isCondensed (boolean): this controls if the diff output is trimmed of unnecessary text that hasn't chnaged or not.
- padding (integer): this is used if isCondensed is set to true to control how much of that unnecessary is preserved in the output.
###### returns
- combined (string): a combined view of both removed and added values to the string
- removed (string): only outputs the removed values and the original values of the diff
- added (string): only outputs the added values and the original values of the diff
- totalLines (integer): the total number of lines (the max value between patch and source in order to get an even output)
- maxLineLength (integer): the longest string value

##### Usage

```js
const _diff = new Optics(source, patch);

_diff.diff({ isCondensed: true, padding: 7 })
```

#### splitDiff

> takes the same arguments that [diff](#diff) does.

##### Usage

```js
const _diff = new Optics(source, patch);

_diff.splitDiff({ isCondensed: true, padding: 7 });
```

> outputs (ansii colors will output if your output supports it)
